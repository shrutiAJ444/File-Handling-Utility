The **File Handling Utility** program in Java demonstrates writing, reading, and modifying text files. It writes content using `BufferedWriter`, reads using `BufferedReader`, and modifies text by replacing words with `Files.readAllLines()`. The `main` method showcases these operations with a sample file. Exception handling ensures smooth execution, making it useful for text processing and file management in Java.
